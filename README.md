!!!needs to have fpdf installed (can install by running 'pip install fpdf' in the terminal)
itertools.permutations: To generate digit permutations for combination testing.

ASCII Art: Displays results in a visually appealing algorithm format.

PDF Export with FPDF: Neatly stores solutions in a professional document.

Features:
Identifies valid addition solutions (A + B + C = D, where D is a four-digit number).

Offers multiple result display options:

Algorithmic ASCII Art

Normal Print Format

Export to PDF for sharing and record-keeping.

User-friendly menu interface for easy operation.

Thorough validation to ensure compliance with number constraints.

Usage:
Run the script and select from these options:

'a': View results as ASCII Art.

'n': Display results in normal text format.

'b': Both ASCII Art and normal format.

'p': Export results to a PDF.
